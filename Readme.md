To run:
-Download the Gridium.jar file.
-Create a file named "citylist.txt" with the list of cities you'd like to get the tides for, carriage return delimited (or download the existing one)
-Run the jar file, as long as the city list file is in the same directory, it will pick out the cities, and display the result on the command line.
